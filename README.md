Entity Framework Core:
 using (var context = new AppDbContext(_dbContextOptions))
            {
                var result = await context.Cars
                    .Include(c => c.Quotes)

                    .Include(c => c.StatusHistories)
                        .ThenInclude(sh => sh.Status)
                    .Select(c => new

2.	When the data doesnâ€™t change:

o	Use Static Classes for Immutable Data: Using static classes to store immutable data that doesn't change frequently but is accessed frequently. Static classes can provide global access to data without the need for instantiation, improving code readability and simplicity.

o	Encapsulate Data in Readonly Properties: Within static classes, encapsulate data in readonly properties to ensure that it remains immutable once initialized. This helps maintain data integrity and prevents unintended modifications.

o	Consider Lazy Initialization: For large datasets or data that may not always be needed, consider lazy initialization to defer the creation of static data until it is accessed for the first time. This can improve application startup time and reduce memory usage.

o	Optimize Memory Usage: Be mindful of memory usage when storing data in static classes, especially if the dataset is large or if multiple static datasets are used. Avoid storing redundant or unnecessary data and periodically review memory usage to identify optimization opportunities.

o	Utilize Caching for Performance: Implement caching mechanisms, such as in-memory caching or distributed caching, to store frequently accessed data. Use static classes to manage cached data and provide efficient global access throughout the application.





3.	Changes to method updateCustomersBalance

public void UpdateCustomersBalanceByInvoices(List<Invoice> invoices)
{
    // List to store unique customer IDs associated with invoices
    var customerIds = invoices.Select(i => i.CustomerId.Value).Distinct().ToList();

    // Query to retrieve all customers associated with invoices in a single call
    var customers = dbContext.Customers.Where(c => customerIds.Contains(c.Id)).ToList();

    //Use a single transaction for all updates
    using (var transaction = dbContext.Database.BeginTransaction())
    {
        try
        {
            foreach (var invoice in invoices)
            {
                //look for the customer associated with the invoice 
                var customer = customers.Single(c => c.Id == invoice.CustomerId.Value);
                
                // Update Balance
                customer.Balance -= invoice.Total;
            }

            // Save Change son DB
            dbContext.SaveChanges();

            // Confirm the transaction
            transaction.Commit();
        }
        catch (Exception)
        {
            // Is Any Issue
            transaction.Rollback();
            throw; 
        }
    }
}

With these changes, we have optimized the method to reduce the number of database queries and improve the performance of updating the customer balance. Now, all updates are performed within a single transaction, ensuring data consistency and reducing operation execution time.

4.	GetOrders Method

public async Task<OrderDTO> GetOrders(DateTime dateFrom, DateTime dateTo,
                                            List<int> customerIds, List<int> statusIds, bool? isActive)
    {

        using (var context = new AppDbContext(_dbContextOptions))
        {
            var query = context.Orders.AsQueryable();

            //Filters based on parameters
            if (dateFrom != DateTime.MinValue)
            {
                query = query.Where(o => o.OrderDate >= dateFrom);
            }
            if (dateTo != DateTime.MinValue)
            {
                query = query.Where(o => o.OrderDate <= dateTo);
            }
            if (customerIds != null && customerIds.Any())
            {
                query = query.Where(o => customerIds.Contains(o.CustomerId));
            }
            if (statusIds != null && statusIds.Any())
            {
                query = query.Where(o => statusIds.Contains(o.StatusId));
            }
            if (isActive.HasValue)
            {
                if (isActive == true)
                {
                    query = query.Where(o => o.IsActive);
                }
                else
                {
                    query = query.Where(o => !o.IsActive);
                }
            }

            var result = await query.Select(o => new OrderDTO
            {
                OrderId = o.OrderId,
                OrderDate = o.OrderDate,
                CustomerId = o.CustomerId,
                StatusId = o.StatusId,
            }).FirstOrDefaultAsync();

            return result;
        }
    }
