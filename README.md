Migrating with .NET Entity Framework Core
1. Add Migration
To add a migration for your Entity Framework Core context, use the following command:

dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>
Replace <MigrationName> with a descriptive name for your migration.

2. Apply Migration
To apply the pending migration to your database, execute:

dotnet ef database update
This command will update your database schema according to the changes defined in the migration.

Running the API
1. Navigate to API Project
First, navigate to the directory containing your API project using the terminal:


cd path/to/your/api/project
Replace path/to/your/api/project with the actual path to your API project.

2. Restore Dependencies
Ensure that all project dependencies are restored by running:

dotnet restore
This command will restore all the dependencies specified in your project's *.csproj file.

3. Build the Project
Build the API project using the following command:

dotnet build
This will compile your project and generate the necessary binaries.

4. Run the API
Finally, start your API by executing:

dotnet run
This command will launch your API application. Once it's running, you can access it through the specified endpoint (e.g., https://localhost:5000).

Additional Notes:
Ensure that your database connection string is correctly configured in your appsettings.json file for Entity Framework Core migrations to work properly.
Make sure that any required environment variables or configuration settings are properly set before running the API.
Always test your migrations and API thoroughly in a development environment before deploying to production.
